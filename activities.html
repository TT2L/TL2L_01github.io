         One of the oldest countries in Europe is Portugal. Not only is Portugal  one of the 
         oldest states in the world, but perhaps all of Europe as well, since its borders were 
         established in 1139. In the same year, King Afonso Henriques became King of Portugal.
         Fun facts:Rome is four centuries younger than Lisbon. The region was home to many empires
         and civilizations before it became known as Portugal, including the Phoenicians in 1200 BC.

            barrel wave that crashes over flat rocks in Ericeira, must be considered the best wave 
            in Portugal. One of the top surf locations in the world, Ericeira has been designated as 
            a World Surf Reserve. Thirty excellent surf locations are within driving distance, along

            The slopes in Portugal are unbeatable for a unique skiing experience. The ski area at Serra de
            Estrela only has four lifts, seven runs, and 130 metres of vertical fall, so it will never be
            able to compete with Whistler or other ski resorts, but it is undoubtedly a rare opportunity
            to ski in one of Europe's warmest nations. Although there are a few trails for intermediates
            and professionals as well, the resort is perfect for novices.

         he rugged cliffs, secret beaches and stunning sea caves of the Algarve coast are made for 
         coasteering, an adventure sport that includes jumping, swimming and climbing. The best place
         to try it is the Costa Vicentina Natural Park, on the coast between Lagos and Sagres in the
         western Algarve. Climbing orange cliffs is fun, but splashing in crystal clear waters and
         exploring secret caves is one of the best ways to discover Portugal's natural beauty. If you've
         never coasteered, it's best to hire a local guide. Because they know exactly when the tide is
         coming and the safest places to jump and swim.

         There are only a few water bungee jumping sites in the world, and one of them is at Albufeira Marina
         in southern Portugal. Participants ride a crane 40 meters in the air, jump and dip their heads into
         the cool Atlantic waters before returning to the platform. A fun way to overcome your fear of heights.
         The sport was introduced to the Algarve by Carlos Mosco Dionisio, a somewhat eccentric bungee jumper
         born in Portugal. He holds the world's record for of the longest bungee jump.
