                There are around forty youth hostels (pousadas de juventude) in Portugal, 
                under the umbrella of the youth organization Movijovem and affiliated to the
                Hostelling International network. You’ll need a valid membership card, 
                available from your home-based youth-hostel association, or you can join on your first night
                at any hostel. There are full details of each hostel on the pousadasjuventude.pt website 
                (also in English), and you can book directly with the hostels, or online or call central 
                reservations on 707 233 030.

                Prices vary according to season, location and facilities, but dorm beds in most cost 
                between €12 and €18 per person (high season is basically July, August, Easter, Christmas 
                and other public holidays).

            Hotels are all classified with one to five stars, and can vary from old buildings with 
            plenty of character, sometimes with owners to match, to top-notch, stylish, luxury resorts. 
            A one-star hotel (which may still be known by its former name as a pensão or resedencial) – 
            usually costs €40–60 and may not have en-suite bathrooms or indeed much else other than 
            the bed, a heavy (and almost never used) wardrobe, and perhaps a chair or table. 
            More upmarket places will have modern en-suite rooms, plus TVs, heaters and air conditioning.
            Breakfast is usually included: expect coffee, bread and preserves, and possibly some 
            sliced ham and cheese.
            </section>

            <section id="para2">
            At two- and three-star hotels, en-suite doubles cost around €80; many three-star places
            have air-conditioned rooms with cable/satellite TV, and even swimming pools, 
            so they can be pretty good value. For rooms with all mod cons in four- and five-star hotels, 
            you’ll pay anything from €120 to €200, while the very fanciest places – 
            boutique hotels in the Algarve or luxury hotels in Lisbon, for example – 
            attract an international clientele and can pretty much charge what they like. 
            Some cosier places of four- or five-star quality, often in a converted historic building
            or manor house in a rural location, are known as estalagems, or inns. 
            All hotels and estalagems/inns serve breakfast, usually (though not always) included 
            in the price. In one- and two-star hotels it tends to be continental-style; 
            more substantial buffet breakfasts are provided at three-star places and up.

                Every area of the country has some sort of self-catering villa or apartment available
                for rent, from basic one-room studios to five- or six-bedroom houses complete with 
                grounds and pool. The minimum rental period is usually a week, and the best deals are 
                often packages, including flights and car rental, with endless tour companies.
