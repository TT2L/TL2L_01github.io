             For getting around in Portugal, we can use public transport because the nation's trains, trams, 
             buses, taxis, and funiculars are hygienic, effective, and easy to use. Over 86 million rail passengers 
             in Portugal travelled 2.2 billion kilometres in 2020, while another 8 billion kilometres were covered
             by tram and bus passengers, according to the International Union of Railways.
