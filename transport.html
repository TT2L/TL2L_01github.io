             For getting around in Portugal, we can use public transport because the nation's trains, trams, 
             buses, taxis, and funiculars are hygienic, effective, and easy to use. Over 86 million rail passengers 
             in Portugal travelled 2.2 billion kilometres in 2020, while another 8 billion kilometres were covered
             by tram and bus passengers, according to the International Union of Railways.

                For the public transportation payment method in Lisbon, we can use the Viva Viagem card. A Viva Viagem is
                a card with an embedded chip. A quick and easy way to pay for public transport in Lisbon. You need to buy
                a Viva Viagem card to use the metro, ferries and S-Bahn. On buses, trams, and cable cars, you can use your
                Viva Viagem card or buy tickets from the more expensive drivers if you don't have one. This Viva Viem card
                is the most recommended for tourists.
