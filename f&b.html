         rice, potatoes, and bread, and there<br>are many traditional fresh bread variants, such as broa, which may also have regional and national differences among the nations influenced by the <br> Lusophone or Galician cultures. Galician and Portuguese cuisine are similar in many 
         ways on a broader scale.

            <p>Thin slices of pork are marinated and cooked in a sauce mixture of white wine, garlic, and paprika to make bifanas,
               which are <br>traditionally eaten in Portugal on soft rolls with plenty of mustard and piri-piri sauce. According to 
               history, the original one<br> originates in the southern Portuguese town of Vendas Novas in the Alentejo region. If you 
               visit,be sure to sample the ones<br> at <b>Café Boavista</b>. The searing steak with mustard makes it feel out of body,
               and the bread is toasted and crunchy.</p>
            
            <p>You know every place will say THEY have the original, but let’s not waste time
               discussing which one is “the original”. Instead, let’s say<br> “Who cares which one 
               is the original! I just want the best one!”</p>
