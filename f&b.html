         rice, potatoes, and bread, and there<br>are many traditional fresh bread variants, such as broa, which may also have regional and national differences among the nations influenced by the <br> Lusophone or Galician cultures. Galician and Portuguese cuisine are similar in many

                The northern region of Portugal, notably the city of Porto, is where the Portuguese Francesinha sandwich originates. Don't think of francesinhas<br> as a simple, light sandwich that
                you consume when you have some empty space in your stomach. This dish weighs A LOT. In other words, eat up it <br>when you are famished and have sufficient room for this monstrosity.

            <p> A rich, meaty sauce, bread, sausages, beef, ham, cheese, and egg. All of this is served with a lot of french fries. That is what I consider a full meal!</p>

            <p>Tigelada is a traditional Portuguese dessert that is highly good and beautifully presented. It is made with beaten eggs, sugar, and milk and baked till golden.
               When the top of the tigeladas has turned golden brown and slightly burnt, but the interior is still smooth and soft, it is removed from the oven and set aside to
               cool before serving. Although many regions claim to have invented the tigeladas, one of the most widely accepted theories is that the dessert was first served as a convent treat in Alcaravela.
