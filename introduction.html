                <b>Portugal</b>, officially <b>Portuguese Republic</b>, Portuguese <b>República Portuguesa</b>, 
                is a country lying along the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe. 
                Once continental Europe’s greatest power, Portugal shares commonalities—geographic and cultural—with the countries
                of both northern Europe and the Mediterranean. The rugged Estrela Mountains (Serra da Estrela, or “Star Mountain Range”),
                which lie between the Tagus and Mondego rivers, contain the highest point of mainland Portugal.

                In the 1st millennium, before the current era, the Celtic Lusitani entered the Iberian Peninsula and settled the land, 
                and many traces of their influence remain. According to national legend, though, Lisbon, the national capital, 
                was not founded by Celts but by the ancient Greek warrior Odysseus, who was said to have arrived at a rocky headland 
                near what is the present-day city after leaving his homeland to wander the world and who, liking what he saw, stayed there
                for a while; his departure was said to have broken the heart of the nymph Calypso, who, the legend goes, turned herself 
                into a snake, her coils becoming the seven hills of Lisbon. Of course, had Odysseus actually come to Portugal,
                he would have found the land already well settled by the Lusitani.

                Lusitani tribes battled the Romans for generations before acceding to empire, whereupon Rome established several important
                towns and ports; the Roman presence can be seen in the very name of the country, which derives from Portus Cale, 
                a settlement near the mouth of the Douro River and the present-day city of Porto. Later, the descendants of Romans and the
                Lusitani would live under Moorish rule for several centuries until an independent kingdom was established.

                <section id="para4">
                In constant battle and rivalry with Spain, its eastern neighbour, Portugal then turned to the sea and, after 
                Henry the Navigator’s establishment of a school of navigation at Sagres, in time founded a vast overseas empire that would
                become Europe’s largest and richest. Much of that empire was quickly lost, but even then Portugal retained sizable 
                holdings along the African coast, in southern and eastern Asia, and in South America. 
                Portugal remained a colonial power until the mid-1970s, when a peaceful revolution transformed the country
                from a dictatorship into a democratic republic. Long among the poorest countries of Europe, Portugal modernized in the
                last decades of the 20th century, expanding its economy from one based primarily on textile manufacture and livestock 
                raising to include a range of manufactures and services.

                <section id="para1">
                Portugal occupies one-sixth of the Iberian Peninsula at Europe’s southwestern perimeter. 
                To its north and east is Spain, which makes up the rest of the peninsula; to the south and the west is the Atlantic Ocean;
                and to the west and southwest lie the Azores (Açores) and the Madeira Islands, which are part of metropolitan Portugal. 
                Portugal is not a large country, but it offers a great diversity of physical geography, 
                ranging from low-lying coasts and plains to the Estrela Mountains, which rise to nearly 6,500 feet (2,000 metres).

                <section id="para2">
                In order to discuss Portugal’s physiographic regions, it is necessary to consider the provincial divisions of the country
                that no longer exist as administrative entities but that survive as important geographical designations. 
                Although superseded by several planning regions and districts that now organize Portugal, 
                six provinces have traditionally divided the country since the Middle Ages 
                (though these never served as administrative units): Minho, located between the Minho and Douro rivers; Trás-os-Montes, 
                bounded by Spain (north and east), by the gorges of the Douro River (south), and by the mountains (west); Beira, 
                extending from the Douro River in the north to the Tagus in the southeast and from the border with Spain 
                to the Atlantic Ocean; Estremadura, containing Lisbon; the Alentejo, covering south-central Portugal; and the Algarve, 
                in southern Portugal. From 1933 to 1959, mainland Portugal also was officially further divided into 11 new provinces that
                were created on a geographic and economic basis: the Algarve, the Alto (Upper) Alentejo, the Baixo (Lower) Alentejo, 
                Beira Alta (Upper Beira), Beira Baixa (Lower Beira), Beira Litoral, Douro Litoral, Estremadura, Minho, Ribatejo,
                and Trás-os-Montes e Alto (Upper) Douro.

                Life expectancy in Portugal is high in comparison with the rest of the world, but it is slightly lower than most other 
                countries in western Europe. Birth rates are about half the world average; death rates are slightly higher than the world
                average. At the beginning of the 21st century, population growth was slow, and it was anticipated to begin a slight
                decline.

                <section id="para2">
                More than nine-tenths of the country’s population are ethnic Portuguese, and there are also small numbers of Brazilians,
                Han Chinese, and people from Portugal’s former colonial possessions in Africa and Asia. 
                Ethnic Marranos (descendants of Jews who converted to Christianity but who secretly continued to practice Judaism) 
                constitute about 1 percent of the population, and the country’s Roma (Gypsy) population lives primarily in the Algarve.

                The decolonization process that took place after the Revolution of the Carnations (April 25, 1974) inevitably had 
                demographic repercussions on metropolitan Portugal because of the large number of people (mostly Portuguese) who left 
                the former overseas provinces. Some one million refugees, most of whom came from Angola in part because of the civil war 
                between the liberation movements, settled in Portugal. The majority of the repatriates (retornados) crowded into 
                Portuguese cities and towns, the effect of which was a high unemployment rate that continued for the next decade.

                <section id="para4">
                Portugal has one of the highest rates of emigration in Europe. Before 1960 most of its émigrés went to Brazil and a few 
                other Latin American countries. The population underwent its only decline in the modern period during the 1960s, 
                when two external developments coincided: severe labour shortages in industrialized western Europe induced an outflow of 
                Portuguese workers, and Portugal’s efforts to suppress the liberation movements in its African colonies prompted thousands 
                of young men to emigrate illegally in order to avoid conscription. From Madeira and the Azores too, emigration was a continuing 
                pattern—from the Azores mainly to the United States and from Madeira mainly to South America.

                On the other hand, language is an extremely common bond: Portuguese is the first language of nearly the entire population.

                <h2>Climate</h2>

                <section id="para1">
                As in Spain, three sets of influences are involved: Atlantic, continental (Mesetan), and Mediterranean. 
                The Atlantic climate predominates overall, putting most of the country into the humid zone of the Iberian Peninsula; 
                this is especially true in the northwest, where the climate is mild and rainy. 
                Summer temperatures near sea level may average up to 76 °F (24 °C) but are rather lower at exposed higher elevations. 
                Winter temperatures average 37 to 40 °F (3 to 4 °C) but tend to be milder south of the Douro. 
                Annual rainfall averages more than 40 inches (1,000 mm).
                </section>

                <section id="para2">
                In the extreme northwest, much of the Minho receives 40 to 80 inches (1,000 to 2,000 mm) of precipitation, 
                with more than 100 inches (2,500 mm) falling on mountain slopes. Inland, lee slopes are arid, receiving at most 20 inches 
                (500 mm), much of which is lost through high evaporation rates. In the interior, continental influences increase the 
                duration of the summer drought to more than a month and intensify winter severity. High-pressure conditions from the 
                Spanish Meseta or from Siberian anticyclones bring very cold temperatures. The Alentejo can experience both acute winter 
                cold and extreme summer heat. In the highest areas of the Estrela Mountains and northern ranges, 
                temperatures drop to 32 °F (0 °C), and snow remains on the summits for several months. 
                In the south, where the Azores high-pressure system prevails in summer, the period of drought lengthens to two months or 
                more. Temperatures average about 75 °F (24 °C) in summer and 50 °F (10 °C) in winter. 
                Mean annual precipitation is slightly more than 20 inches (500 mm) along the coast and a bit higher in the mountains of 
                the Algarve. Nevertheless, there is considerable climatic variability from one year to the next.
                </section>

                <section id="para3">
                Mediterranean, Saharan, and oceanic influences produce seasonal precipitation, occasional dry winds, 
                and thermal equability, respectively, in the Madeiras. Climate varies markedly with altitude. 
                In the Azores the anticyclone dominates, though conditions can be highly variable. Rainfall, for example, 
                is irregular both in annual total and in regime: Horta (on Faial Island) may have more than 40 inches (1,000 mm)
                a year or may suffer severe drought.
