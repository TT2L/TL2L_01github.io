                 caves, has lovely weather all year round, and is a surfing haven.
                There are so many things to do here that you might as well stay all summer. The Algarve offers
                 some of the top hiking opportunities. You might begin by going to Ferragudo, a wonderful fishing
                  village with a blend of old-world beauty and seaside freshness.</p>

                    <p>Aveiro is referred regarded as the Venice of Portugal because, like the Italian city, 
                        it has an estuary that runs through the middle of the city. Moliceiros, the local boats,
                         go along the estuary while giving scenic tours. In addition to the city's tourist 
                         attractions, the Aveiro area has a lot more to offer outside of the city, including
                          beaches and distinctive Portuguese delicacies, making a trip there unlike any other.</p>

                <p>There are so many amazing features in this city. The city itself served as the European Capital of Culture in 2012,
                     and its historic centre is a UNESCO World Heritage site. For the Portuguese, Guimares holds unique significance 
                     because it was here that the nation's foundations were laid during the Battle of So Mamede in 1128. The first
                      King of Portugal, Afonso Henriques, came out on top and started the process of creating this tiny but wonderful 
                      nation. The Ducal Palace, which was built in the 15th century and is now a palace and a museum, must be seen in
                       addition to the mediaeval castle from the tenth century. And for a tranquil afternoon, meander down Rua de Santa 
                       Maria, the most lovely street in the city.</p>

                    <p>This award-winning building, also known as the Paiva Walkways, checks all the 
                        environmental boxes. The Paiva Walkways offer a strenuous but extremely rewarding 
                        eight-kilometer hike over an elevated boardwalk that dips, climbs, and meanders 
                        through the Arouca Geopark, an unspoiled landscape of outstanding beauty and a
                         biodiversity hotspot, outside of the town of Arouca, which is located 70 kilometres 
                         north of Aveiro in central Portugal.</p><br>
                        <p>The stroll starts at Areinho and proceeds downstream 
                        along the pristine River Paiva. You'll soon be hiking through a wild, 
                        uncommon landscape of serene, lush woodland and wide, gaping gorges.
                        You pass peaceful swimming pools with reflective surfaces and cascading
                         waterfalls on the way. The course really puts your energy and strength to the 
                         test as it frequently entails traversing long flights of zigzagging steps over high inclines.</p>
