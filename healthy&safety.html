            <p>
                The good news is that Portugal is frequently ranked as one of Europe's <b>safest travel destinations.</b>
                In fact, it came in <b>third place</b> overall among 163 nations on the Global Peace Index. The index is 
                calculated by taking into account variables including the crime rate, terrorist attacks, violent protests, 
                political climate, and international relations.
                Portugal does well in each of these areas.
                 One of the reasons Portugal is regarded as safe is that its firearms regulations are not lightly enforced.
                 Portugal experiences few violent crimes, and when they do, they typically don't involve tourists. Even so,
                  every traveller should take the standard safety precautions and stay in frequented areas.
